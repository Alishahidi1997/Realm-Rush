## Gameplay

In "Realm Rush," you take on the role of a castle's defense commander. Your primary objective is to repel the relentless enemy hordes. Strategically place your defense towers along the path of the oncoming enemies. Each tower has a specific range within which it can target and attack enemies. These towers will tirelessly fire arrows at any foes that draw near, reducing their numbers.

Each enemy that successfully breaches your gate will cost you coins, depleting your resources. However, for every enemy you eliminate, you earn additional coins. Balancing incoming and outgoing resources is where your strategic skills come into play.

As you progress through the game, enemy units become faster and tougher, intensifying the challenge. Your ability to adapt and fine-tune your strategy, including tower placement and range considerations, is crucial to your kingdom's survival. Manage your resources wisely, construct new defense towers, and upgrade existing ones to hold back the relentless enemy onslaught.

## Conclusion

"Realm Rush" is more than just a game; it's a test of your strategic thinking and resource management abilities. Your kingdom relies on your tactical expertise to defend the castle gates, keeping the enemy at bay and considering arrow range for each tower.
